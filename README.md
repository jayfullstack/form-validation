Welcome to Form Validation!

This project contains a simple form to record user data.

Validation was provided using built-in standard HTML attributes in conjunction with JavaScript.

For the purposes of this project,
User data was captured to display in a console.log.

In the real world, this data will be sent somewhere through a server and handled by some backend functionality for storage.
